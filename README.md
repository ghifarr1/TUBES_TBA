The key idea is to developed a simple MRT ticketing system using the C programming language, designed to streamline the ticket purchasing process. This project enables users to select departure and destination stations, calculate fares based on distance, and choose between cash or e-money for payment. Upon successful payment, the system generates a digital receipt containing travel details.

Key Features:
- Station & Fare List: Displays a list of MRT stations along with their respective fares.
- Station Selection: Users can select their starting and destination stations to determine ticket prices.
- Payment Methods: Supports cash and e-money transactions with balance validation.
- Receipt Generation: Issues a ticket receipt upon successful payment.
- Input Validation: Ensures users enter valid options to prevent errors.
